        <p> <strong>Abhyast (with Boeing):</strong> Abhyast is an autonomous vehicle being undertaken as a joint activity of IIT Kanpur and Boeing Corporation. The objective is to develop a robot which acts as an aid to the operator in carrying specific task rather than an entity which is in need of continuous attention of operator. Its a 30cm x 30cm x 30cm robot capable of navigating from source to destination using various local and global sensors and is capable of communicating to the user using pre-established GSM network</p>
        <p><strong>Jugnu:</strong> Jugnu is one of the world's tiniest Nano satellites, weighing only three kilograms. Designed and fabricated by the mechanical engineering department, it was a part of the Golden Jubilee celebrations of IIT Kanpur. Developed using indigenous technology and manpower (students and professors only) this satellite (34cm long) was developed at a cost of 2.5 crores. Launched by ISRO's PSLV C-18 on 12th Oct 2011, it has been continuously monitored and controlled by the Ground Station located at IIT K campus. Development of JUGNU started in the year 2008 with a team of 3 students and few professors, which gradually grew to a team of more than 50 students ranging from 1st year undergraduates to final year postgraduates along with 14 professors from different disciplines to complete this challenging mission</p>
