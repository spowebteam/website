    <div class="headline"><h4>Guidelines</h4></div>
    <ul>
      <li>The role of the SPO (Students' Placement Office) is of a <strong>facilitator and counselor for placement related activities</strong>. SPO <strong>does NOT guarantee a job</strong>. Applying for a company or joining a company is entirely the responsibility/decision of the student concerned.</li>
      <li>The placement facility is available to all the students registered with SPO throughthe policy <em>One job to one student at the first instance</em></li>
      <li>There is <strong>no restriction</strong> on applying/appearing in interviews <strong>until the first job</strong> is secured. A student will be considered to have secured a job if his/her name appears in the selection list or an appointment letter is received in the SPO.</li>
      <li>Students must keep their <strong>Identity Card</strong> with them at the time of PPT/Test/Group Discussion/ Interviews, and produce the same when demanded by the visiting team or SPO staff or their representatives.</li>
      <li>Once a student has been shortlisted by a company for placement process he/she is NOT allowed to contact the members of the team visiting the campus for placement purpose without prior permission of the Chairman SPC.</li>
      <li>The SPO strongly <strong>discourages the students to go for off campus placements in the companies that already come to IITK campus</strong> as this affects the company-institute relations adversely. Students are also requested to forward contacts they have, if any, in different companies so that SPO may formally invite these companies for placements.</li>
      <li>If a student is found doctoring his/her resume submitted at SPO his/her registration at SPO will be cancelled immediately and also the matter will be referred to SSAC.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="headline"><h4>Pre-Placement Offers (PPO)</h4></div>
    <ul>
      <li>All Pre Placement Offers by any company whatsoever, extended to any student, have to be immediately intimated to the Placement Office by the student after registration. This also includes offers extended by companies that are not participating in the 2011-12 campus placements.</li>
      <li>All companies contacted will also be asked in advance about any Pre Placement offers that have been extended by them and the company will be informed about our PPO policy in advance.</li>
      <li>Also, any form of intimation from a company about the possibility of a PPO being granted in future should be informed to the Placement Office. The Placement Office will take up the matter with the company further and the student will be allowed to sign Job Announcement Form(JAF) as per the normal policy until a decision regarding the grant of a PPO is made.</li>
      <li>A student offered a Pre Placement Offer through SPO must accept/reject the offer prior to the date specified by the company.</li>
      <li>Students accepting or denying a PPO will have to immediately notify the Placement Office of the same. If the PPO is accepted, the job will be recorded and he/she will NOT be allowed to participate in the campus placements. However, he/she will be allowed to participate in the process if the offer is rejected. The rejection letter will be sent to the company through SPO.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any student found to have breached any of these rules or secured a PPO and not informed the placement office of the same will be debarred from the placement process. If at the time of breach the student is already placed, the company in which he/she is placed will be intimated of the violation. </p>
    <div class="headline"><h4>Penalty Structure</h4></div>
    <p>Each student will be assigned a total of 10 points at the time of registration with SPO. Points will be deducted from his record for misconduct as per the following rules. Losing all the 10 points or more will lead to deregistration from SPO. Re-registration may be done at the discretion of Chairman, SPC and/or after paying a monetary penalty.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A student will be allowed to be exempted from compulsory attendance for PPT for a maximum of 2 companies due to genuine reasons* by filling a leave application form (which can be downloaded <code><a href="#">here</a></code> within 2 days after PPT.</li>
